# 120 Years of Olympic history -- Athletes and results

This is a simple **practice** data analysis project. The aim is simply to learn `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, and related Python-based data analysis tools.

### What is this?

This is a small data analysis project using the [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home). The questions that are being "answered" here are all made up. They'll probably get better (or seem more useful) in future revisions. The sole objective is learning.

The dataset has been downloaded and extracted into the `data` subdirectory. So there's no need to download it after cloning this repository.

### How to use this

To use this, you need the following Python libraries (in addition to Python itself, of course):

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

The simplest way to get all of these installed is to simply install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). The code in the notebooks uses Python 3.

To open the notebook, just run `jupyter notebook` from the project root directory.

### The notebook

This project comprises a single notebook. You can access it [here](./120-years-of-olympic-history.ipynb)

### Prerequisites

This is about learning Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. One is expected to have Python knowledge (although I don't) and know how to use the `Jupyter` environment.

### Feedback? Updates

Feedback is welcome (it's a learning project, remember)...

### TODO

There are a few items that are known as issues or as pending improvements. Among these:

* Some graphs have dirty categories, looking like `(index, actual_factor)`.
